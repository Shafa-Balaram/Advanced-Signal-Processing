# Advanced Signal Processing (Coursework)
A collection of statistical signal processing techniques with examples of applications to real-world biomedical signals like ECG and speech recordings. The emphasis is on both classical and modern estimation theory, parametric and nonparametric modeling, time series analysis, least squares methods, and the fundamentals of adaptive signal processing. All codes are implemented and tested using Matlab R2017a.
